# prework-study-guide 
A study guide for course pre-work

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

- I wanted to learn basics of coding before starting the 1st class
- The have a real project to learn basics of coding and the use of the GitHub abd Repo
- While building and gong through the lesson, I learned several troubleshooting skills, simply googling the answers at times.
- I learned several basic lessons and commands of HTML, CSS and Java as well as version control via Git and Github, and how to create branches and merge them to the MAIN project. I also learned how to review the program and use the DevTools to see our work in action!
